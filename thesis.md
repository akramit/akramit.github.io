# New Bounds and Variants of VC Dimension of Boolean Function Classes

Due to the connection of VC-dimension and sample complexity lower bounds,
we take the work further to compute VC-dimension bounds for family of non-monotone Boolean functions.
We study VC-dimension of Boolean function families parameterized by the alternation and show the following results:
* **Exact VC-dimension for family of functions with alternation 1:** We show that family of functions with alternation 1 has VC-dimension exactly
* **Tight bounds for VC-dimension for family of functions with alternation k:** We
show (Theorem 4.2.4 and 4.2.5) that the family of functions F with alternation n+k
n ≤VC(F )≤O k× n .For k ≤ n the upper and lower bounds are asymptotically of the same order and
k has VC-dimension
* **Application to VC-dimension of disjoint union of families**: If a family F is of VC-dimension ≤ d, how large can the VC-dimension of the k-fold union family, defined as, Fk = {∪ki=1Ai | Ai ∈ ∀i, Ai ∈ F} be? Blumer et al Blais et al. (2015) and Haussler and Welzl Haussler and Welzl (1987) showed that the VC-dimension is at most O(dk log k). This bound was shown to be tight by Eisenstat and Angluin (2007) who shows existence of a geometric family with VC-dimension at most d and the k-fold union has VC-dimension at least Ω(dk log k). The family constructed were point sets in a plane. Using our methods, we construct a family of Boolean functions such that k-fold union has VC-dimension at least Ω(dk) ( Theorem 4.3.4) even when the unions in the k-fold union are restricted to k-fold disjoint union.
s-extremal Families: Let Sh(F) be set of sets shattered by family F. For an s- extremal family, |Sh(F)| = |F|. We show that family of Monotone Boolean functions is s-extremal. We also demonstrated a function g such that upon removing from the family of Monotone Boolean functions, resultant family is still s-extremal. Thus showing that Meszaros-Ronyai Conjecture holds true for family of Monotone Boolean functions ( Proposition 4.4.4).
hence the bound is tight in general.

* **Subspace VC Dimension or SVC**: WestudySubspaceVC-dimensionmotivateddue to a possible role in separating the classes AC0 and CC0. We first observe that for any family F, SVC(F) ≤ VC(F). We computed SVC of Monotone, Family of Parity, Symmetric Boolean families.

We study VC-dimension of a single Boolean function, determine the hardness of compu- tation, and establish few connections with other Boolean function complexity measures.

* **VC-dimension of Boolean function** We compute VC-dimension of Boolean functions such as Parity, Majority, Threshold(T hnk ), Monotone, k-slice, Symmetric function.
* **Complexity of Computing** On the Complexity of Computing VC(f ), we proved that this problem is NP-hard and gave a characterization which puts the problem into
* **Relation with other complexity measures** We gave a relation between certificate complexity and VC(f ) which establishes path with other complexity measures of a Boolean function ( Proposition 5.2.4).
